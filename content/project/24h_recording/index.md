Ongoing of 24 hour recordings:

One of my practices is to listen to a place for 24 hours while simultaneously recording it. This is not about merely collecting recordings; it’s about immersing myself in the act of listening to a specific, chosen location for a continuous 24-hour period.

A 24-hour recording captures the full cycle of a day, merging the auditory experience with sociocultural contexts and unpredictable occurrences. Whether in pristine nature or the heart of the city, phenomena like the Aurora — the awakening — are, much like the setting sun, immediate and tangible experiences. The Aurora serves as a prime example: an event that, perhaps unexpectedly, reveals itself as an auditory phenomenon.

Every place has its own unique rhythm. The seeming banality of events is transformed when their repetitive nature becomes clear. When the rhythm of a place is fully perceived — a process requiring both patience and time — it offers a deeper, illuminating understanding of the events and their significance.
