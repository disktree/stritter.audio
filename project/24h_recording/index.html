One of my practices is to listen to a place for 24 hours while simultaneously recording it. This is not about merely collecting recordings; it’s about immersing myself in the act of listening to a specific, chosen location for a continuous 24-hour period.
A 24-hour recording captures the full cycle of a day, merging the auditory experience with sociocultural contexts and unpredictable occurrences. Whether in pristine nature or the heart of the city, phenomena like the Aurora — the awakening — are, much like the setting sun, immediate and tangible experiences. The Aurora serves as a prime example: an event that, perhaps unexpectedly, reveals itself as an auditory phenomenon."><meta property="og:locale" content="en_us"><meta property="og:type" content="article"><meta property="article:section" content="project"><meta property="article:published_time" content="2022-03-23T00:00:00+00:00"><meta property="article:modified_time" content="2025-03-25T18:46:07+01:00"><meta property="og:image" content="https://disktree.github.io/stritter.audio/feature.jpg"><meta name=twitter:card content="summary_large_image"><meta name=twitter:image content="https://disktree.github.io/stritter.audio/feature.jpg"><meta name=twitter:title content="24h recordings"><meta name=twitter:description content="Ongoing of 24 hour recordings:
